## 👋 About Me

Quantitative researcher with a strong foundation in mathematics and programming, currently completing an MSc in Financial Engineering. My focus lies in volatility modelling, derivative pricing, and risk analytics, with hands-on experience in rough volatility, deep learning, and GARCH-based modelling. I bring a rigorous academic background together with industry experience across asset management and banking, and I am particularly passionate about research-driven approaches to market risk and quantitative strategy.
