# Zacch Lines

I am reading for an MSc in Financial Engineering from EDHEC and hold a first-class Mathematics degree from Durham University. With hands-on experience in financial markets, I developed Python-based risk tools during my internship for a Multi-Family Office in Singapore and applied machine learning techniques at NatWest in London to optimise data-driven solutions. My expertise lies in volatility modelling, derivatives pricing, and market microstructures, complemented by a strong ability to solve complex problems and deliver results in high-pressure environments.

## Background

I hold a first-class degree in Mathematics from Durham University and am currently completing a Masterâ€™s in Financial Engineering at EDHEC. My academic background includes stochastic processes, statistical modeling, and numerical methods â€” which form the basis of my work in financial markets.

My interests lie in building and applying models for pricing, hedging, and risk measurement â€” with a particular focus on volatility surfaces and quantitative derivatives strategies.
